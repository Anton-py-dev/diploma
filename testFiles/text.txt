Hello! My name is Alice. I am a student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I am majoring in Computer Science, and I love programming! I have been learning Python, Java, and C++ in my classes. In my free time, I enjoy playing sports, such as basketball and volleyball, and listening to music. Recently, I have been interested in machine learning and natural language processing. I think it's fascinating how computers can understand and analyze human language. I'm excited to continue exploring these topics and see where they take me!
